	[Changes]

0.20
	-First documented version. It was able to generate only OEM keys with number of keys as argument
	-UNIX style arguments (for instance; -d for debug, -s for silent)
	-Had a basic system of exit codes

0.21
	-Implemented -d for debug and -s for silent mode as argument options for the #main script

0.30
	-Turned #main script into main() function, essentially turning this entirely into function oriented
	-Created initialization of arguments as variables (nessesary for functions to have access to them)

0.31
	-Removed init() function, instead requiring each operation to initialize itself
	-Shrunk main() function for efficiency
	-Changed the order with which main() handles arguments

0.32
	-Errors are now directed to stderr instead of stdout
	-Removed BASH variable caller "$" where unnessesary
	-Added GNU style arguments (for instance; --debug for debug mode)

0.40
	-Added help() function with a full blown manual
	-Added license() function to display license at runtime
	-Removed generate_debug() as it's become too difficult to maintain (no worries, it will come back)
	-Renamed generate() to win95oem()
	-Added abstract functions w95cd(), wntoem(), and wntcd()
	-Added Java style toString() function
	-Added SPDX-License-Identifier for automated identification of license (GPL3+)

0.41
	-MAJOR reimplementation of first and second segments of OEM key generation
	-Fixed major bug disallowing the previous verson to run at all
	-Implemented caller for validation of keys in main()
	-Intoduced exit code for "Invalid argument: product type"
	-main() now calls the appropriate function directly based on the first argument

0.42
	-Removed old deprecated code (for the first and second segments of OEM)
	-Renamed w95oem() to oem() and w95cd() to cd()
	-Removed main() handling of wntoem and wntcd as they are identical to the w95 counterparts
	-Added abstract function cd() (not etirely abstract, it does a loop for testing purposes)

0.43
	-Finally implemented the cd() generating function, allowing for generation of all types of keys
	-Modified help()'s list of examples to be more helpful

0.44
	-Moved help() below the payload of the script
	-Reimplemented debug mode for OEM only as oem_debug()

0.45
	-Implemented brand new cd_debug() in the style of oem_debug()
	-Modernized oem_debug() to fit the current more efficient version of oem()
	-Multiple detailed improvements of main()
	-Expanded on end-of-script-error adding details and email for bug reports
	-Heavy use of "\t" in strings, to make the output easier to interpret

0.46
	-Corrected SPDX license identifier
	-Added validate_oem() and validate_cd() abstract functions for
		Uses the same algorithms as oem() and cd() but reverse engineered to validate
		whether or not keys are correct
	-Changed formatting options for displaying text in bold (has not been updated since v0.20)

0.50
	-Added Copyright mention to license()
	-Added exit codes and appropriate placement of:
		exit code 4 : Validator: invalid format
		exit code 5 : Validator: invalid Key
		exit code 6 : Internal check failed!
	-Introduced global variable $KEY for convenient access by all functions
		Global variables in BASH are quite common, and do not have the stigma they do in
		other languages
	-toString() now handles displaying and formatting of $KEY

0.51
	-Newlines "\n" are now handled by printf in toString() rather than individually
	-Added "-v" and "--validate" as arguments
	-Implemented version numbering by the $VERSION variable
	-Partially restructured main()
	-help() is now displayed when no arguments are given

0.52
	-Introduced new usage() function, displaying a short synopsis
	-usage() is displayed instead of help()
	-Added some elements of internal checking algorithm

0.53
	-Introduced check_oem() abstract function
		validate_oem() checks whether a user inputed a valid key whereas
		check_oem() would check whether the program is making internal errors during oem() key generation
	-Implemented efficient error handling by validate_cd()
	-Fixed bugs where check_cd() was trying to access variables that do not exist or were renamed
	-Added $REPORT variable, which displays info on reporting bugs when they occur, instead of
	 just displaying the appropriate error message

0.54
	-Using DeMorgen law, many test conditions are now simplified
	-check_cd() completely removed as it will require a rewrite from scratch

0.60
	-New implementation of check_cd() with efficiency in mind
	-validate_oem() and validate_cd() now test if certain segments are integers where they need to be
	-Temporarily implemented a horrible inefficient way of solving the DECIMAL PROBLEM
		BASH interprets numbers like 076 as octal numbers, not decimal. There is a way to force
		decimal interpretation, however it is not suited for my program as it requires that strings
		entirely consist digits, not a mix of digits and other characters
	-Suppressed irrelevant output of internal BASH functions (specifically if statements)
	-More "\t" handling outsourced to toString()

0.61
	-Removed some debugging code (not part of the debug functions) that was used for testing
	-Reimplemented mathematical validation section of check_cd()

0.62
	-IMPLEMENTED validate_oem() AND check_oem() FOR THE FIRST TIME
	-Rewrote integer testing with the help of DeMorgan law
	-Added many #TODO statements where appropriate for future repairs
	-Added bold text to error output where it's needed

0.70
	-Added $EMAIL variable making it easier to change report-to email (only has to be changed in 1 place)
	-Added dead code explaining what functions do
	-Removed old code which was not being used
	-Changed the way validate_oem() and validate_cd() test for correct format
	-Changed the way validate_oem() and validate_cd() display format errors
	-Reinstated validation of $S2 segment in check_oem()
	-Initialization now happens before Format validation in validate_cd() (reducing unhandled errors)
	-check_cd() now has more efficient mathematical validation
	-toString() now interacts with validate_oem() and validate_cd()
	-Multiple miscellaneous fixes to printable strings throughout the entire script

0.80
	-Forked this project creating a new "uOttawa" compliant version
	-Modified all string lines to not be longer than 80 characters
	-Removed ALL textual mentions of Microsoft and their products
	-Changed email from personal to uottawa
	-Updated help(), usage(), and license()

0.81
	-Got rid of the underline of key output in debug mode
	-Changed consistency of validate_oem() and validate_cd() stderr at invalid format
	-Changed how validate_oem(), validate_cd(), check_oem(), and check_cd() obtain value $g
	-Modified $REPORT string
	-Listed changing while to for loops in main() as TODO's
	-Introduced new C style zero_remover() function:
		-Used for forcing decimal interpretation of integers
		-Includes $DEC variable (input & output of function)
		-Also includes $LENDEC variable (required for static length of $DEC before it is changed)
	-EXPERIMENTALLY Implemented zero_remover() in check_cd()

0.82
	-FINALLY SOLVED THE DECIMAL PROBLEM IN ERROR CHECKING FUNCTIONS, PRESENT SINCE v0.50 and
	 partially solved with a horrible method in v0.60	
	-POSIX-COMPLIANCY: Replaced $(expr length $VAR) with ${#VAR} in validate_oem() and validate_cd()
		This officially means the script no longer relies on GNU coreutils and should
		run on MacOS and other POSIX-compliant systems that have BASH
	-Removed deprecated code from check_cd()
	-Implemented zero_remover() in validate_oem(), check_oem(), and validate_cd()
	-Removed Format Validation from check_oem() and check_cd() making them 7.56 times as efficient!

0.90
	-Merged uOttawa fork into master
	-Added new warranty() function for displaying sections 15, 16, and 17 of GNU GPL3
	-Upgraded $REPORT into report() with exhaustive argument handling
	-Removed toString()
	-Fixed bug in main() where erronious $ARG3 arguments weren't being handled
	-Added many exit 0 instances in main under the "generate multiple keys" section
	-Upgrade for loop to while loop in zero_remover()
	-Removed 2 unessential variables in zero_remover() making it largely more efficient
	-Added extra spacing in main()

0.91
	-Added exit 3 as ARG3 invaid, bumping exits from 3 to 8 with 4 to 9
	-Fixed ARG3 invalid printf bug (where the invalid argument was being
	 interpreted by printf instead of just being displayed
